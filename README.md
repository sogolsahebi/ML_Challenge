# Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview
This project is part of the coursework for CSC311H5 , aiming to apply machine learning techniques to predict which city a student is referring to based on their responses about several popular cities. The challenge emphasizes building a robust classifier that performs well on unseen data, with constraints on the tools and libraries we can use for the final model.
