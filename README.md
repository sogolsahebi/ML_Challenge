# Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview
This project is part of the coursework for CSC311H5 , aiming to apply machine learning techniques to predict which city a student is referring to based on their responses about several popular cities. The challenge emphasizes building a robust classifier that performs well on unseen data, with constraints on the tools and libraries we can use for the final model.

- `/data`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. 
- `/scripts`: 
    - `data_processing.py`: Script for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
    - `model.py`: The main script where our model is implemented.
    - `pred.py`: Script for making predictions on the test set.
- `clean_dataset.csv`: The cleaned dataset file, ready for model training, located in the root directory.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, repository structure, and instructions for setting up and running the project.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. The scripts use the following additional libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
